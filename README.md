# Portfolio-bootcamp-homework

My portfolio Consists of a website that holds contents about me, my work, and contact informtation. I incuded my name and photo at the top in the header, as well as a navbar to dirrect you to the given location on the website. Five Photos that eventually will be replaced with my aplications. A side bar that has the about me section to give some contect about myself, and a footer with given contact information.
